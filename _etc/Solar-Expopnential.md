title: "Exponential Growth of Solar"
---
Two weeks after Radical Technology Revisited another world record price for solar energy was set in [Abu Dhabi at $24/megawatt hour][2] cutting the August Chile record by another 17%.  That’s less than tuppence a unit in our money, somewhere between a quarter and a fifth of the strike price agreed for Hinckley Point.  Abu Dhabi get less than two and a half times as much electricity as we do, so this translates into electricity at half the price of Hinckley – but 10 or morte years earlier.  The cost of solar energy is hardly likely to go up, and actually likely to halve again and maybe halve again before Hinckley opens – so, 1p to 2p per unit for solar electricity.

Way back in May 2015, The Lawrence Berkeley national laboratory seriously asked, [Is $50 solar viable?][3]  Might there be conditions where solar only cost $50/megawatt?  A year later it is less than half that in sunny spots, meaning it is approaching $50 even in the UK.  it is hard to imagine that we are not going to get exponentially increasing installs well before the government’s nuclear strategy comes to fruition.  This might sound like a problem – but it’s really an opportunity for this country to have abundant clean energy and decarbonise well before we imagined in Paris.  The International Energy Agency need to learn how to track exponential growth!

Hinckley C can be the white elephant of all white elephants.  We don't need Bradwell B or Sizewell C to turn it into a herd or a stampede.  I’m sure our prime minister is smart, but she is not being well advised. Or rather she is probably being excessively advised, from too many sides, with information that does not include the exponentially collapsing cost of solar PV.  If solar electricity is wholesaling at £10-20/Mwh by the time HPC opens (i.e. no more expensive than in Abu Dhabi already, so that’s fairly likely, given that the Abu Dhabi/Dubai projects are still very profitable), the government (meaning us) will face a 35 year bill of:  (3.2 gigawatts  x  8765 hours per year  x  35 years  x  (£92.50/megawatt hour strike price less £10-20 average wholesale solar price)  x  90% uptime)  **=  £68Bn**.  Rather more than twice the £30Bn ’subsidy’ mentioned in this [White elephant ][4]article.

That doesn’t include any shift in the retail price index in 35 years, which is unlikely – though I’d argue it’s as likely to go down because of cheap solar energy as it is to go up because of expensive nuclear energy. I defer to  [Wikipedia on Hinckley][5] which expects the strike price to be £120 by the time Hinckley C is operational.  If grid electricity prices fall, with super cheap solar, the UK consumer **lifetime subsidy to Hinckley could be £92Bn+.**

As a guide, that would be enough to put solar panels and storage systems on 20 million homes at TODAY’s prices, giving them energy for half price or less forever.  Versus electricity at double the price? Your choice?…

So this analysis is _least_ supportive of nuclear power;  not particularly supportive of wind energy which is starting to look expensive against solar; and would argue for a 100% solar energy economy – but for one thing…

**The most obvious objection to solar energy is winter. ** The lesser problem is night. ** But objections fail. ** Nights are taken care of by battery storage, and better yet by electric vehicles negotiating the night-time use of their batteries with the owner’s smartphone.  We’re only a year or so away from our phones being smarter than we are, I’m sure.  **Winter was taken care of, ****thoroughly in 1975** by world leading electrochemist [John O’Mara Bockris][6] working at Imperial College.  His book ‘Energy - The Solar Hydrogen Alternative’ proposes a [Hydrogen Economy][7] in which gas grids are converted from natural gas to hydrogen – before natural gas we had town gas, which was 50% hydrogen. In summer we fill the grid with hydrogen from electrolysis of surplus solar electricity; in winter we warm our homes, power fuel cell cars and make electricity using the hydrogen.  QED?

Interestingly, support comes from an unexpected quarter for switching the gas grid back from north sea natural gas (methane) to hydrogen.  In September, just before the Hinckley decision, the Parliamentary Advisory Group on Carbon Capture and Storage (PAGCCS) published their report [Lowest Cost Decarbonisation for the UK: The Critical Role of CCS][8].  It advocates stripping methane of its carbon in coastal refineries where the methane enters the UK, by catalytic steam reforming – and putting the hydrogen in the gas grid, and storing the resultant carbon dioxide (CCS) back under the north sea.  This is the only way they can see to cost effectively decarbonise fossil fuels,  In affect it is an end-of-life kicker to our natural gas reserves (or Russian gas) – and it converts the gas grid to hydrogen, where it can also be increasingly fed by hydrogen from solar power.

**The Future of Community Energy.**  Sometimes a clear view of what’s possible comes from the bottom.  In a world with the potential for delocalised generation of energy, suddenly, communities have tremendous power, and can drive the buying decisions.  Starting with our first experiments in solar energy, in 2011 two solar co-ops in Bristol spent 2 years raising quarter of a million pounds, putting it all into solar roofs.  Last year, local energy groups raised over £59m for renewables.  That’s a trajectory, and if retail prices for energy are four times the wholesale price, what is to stop communities generating all their own energy and selling it to themselves for less?

**Physics vs Politics**.  Technology curves took solar energy past the point where it needed subsidies to get going – FiTs were great while they lasted, and communities are grateful for the boost.  Now, communities have the experience, and the finance community knows the numbers – and the solar technology and the storage technology and the EV technology are moving very quickly.  Individuals and Communities are going to run with this, and governments and corporations are likely to find that the balance of power has shifted to communities – become delocalised.  I hope to help make it happen – and we already have finance knocking on the door.

it would be great to discuss these ideas some more and bounce them against those of others.  It can only improve both sets!  And hopefully help government, and communities, and developers work better together.

**_I added in conclusion_**

Currently my main focus is developing an integrated model for delivering highly sustainable high-tech straw bale buildings, at Passivhaus level for community groups.  We’ve helped build a 30 home community, LILAC in Leeds, and two groups of 7 homes in Bristol with two groups of 12 more in development to take the straw wall and partitioning technologies to the level it outperforms conventional brick and mortar, and can create truly affordable homes..  Both the the ideas for Housing and for Energy were presented and discussed at think tank events this summer – The Future of Energy and [The Future of Housing][9] (on Youtube video) – together with local partners who can deliver the results.  These ideas are evolving into presentations and delivery partnerships – and of course we are networked with groups in other communities who have similar ideas and aspirations.

Thornton I hope this helps and isn’t too late.   There were two reports that the government had – one this PAGCCS report, and another from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) ‘[Hinckley C - What if?][10]’  both were clear, well reasoned, and damning enough of Hinckley.  Many others have added their points and basically been overruled by a political decision.  I Offer this morsel / quotation by way of explanation? Consolation?

_Anyone who has engaged in political controversy will have experienced a moment of elation when they produce an argument that is so clear, so logical, so morally certain, so factually accurate and so elegantly presented that they cannot imagine how anyone could read it and fail to be convinced. It is best to get these delusions out of your system early in a writing career, because readers rarely accept arguments that challenge their interests."_ From Nick Cohen’s book 'You Can't Read This Book' page 174 in the chapter 'People Don't Want To Know - Rules for Censors'

But I would add that in this case there is nothing to prevent communities from rolling out their own, lower cost, solar energy infrastructure well be foer Hinckley C opens, and the sooner it is done the more likely it is that Sizewell C and Bradwell B won’t be built, and even Hinckley could still be stopped in its tracks.

If Bob Dylan can gat a Nobel Prize, and Michelle Obama can torpedo Trump, and if Sadiq Khan can bring London local rail services in to Transport for London (= renationalise), and Nicola Sturgeon can derail Theresa May, then we are still in the Age of Miracles and anything is possible.  Even meta-paradigm shifts.

[Can the UK solve its energy trilemma without Hinkley Point C](http://eciu.net/reports)
[Lowest Cost Decarbonisation for the UK: The Critical Role of CCS][19]  – Lord Oxburgh’s ‘Report to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy from the Parliamentary Advisory Group on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)’.  As reported in The Guardian – ‘[UK must move now to save consumers billions, report says][20]’..

[19]: http://www.ccsassociation.org/news-and-events/reports-and-publications/parliamentary-advisory-group-on-ccs-report/
[20]: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/12/uk-must-move-now-on-carbon-capture-to-save-consumers-billions-says-report

This report, commissioned by Amber Riudd, is well worth a read.  120 mentions of ‘hydrogen’, 60 of ‘electric’, a smattering of ‘Renewable’ and no mention of solar or PV at all – but a good handful of ’Shell’.  Oxburgh was the man who put Royal Dutch Petroleum and Shell together, and I’m sure he is the ’safe pair of hands’ chosen to deliver a clean future for the fossil energy industry, if you can handle the oxymoron.

Here’s the plan:-   We import natural gas, and at the point where it lands we convert it to hydrogen by ‘catalytic steam reforming’ – making hydrogen and carbon dioxide, pumping the latter back under the north sea – i.e. carbon capture and storage.  We convert our gas grid to hydrogen and – hey presto – we have a clean gas grid, and the hydrogen economy arrives, paid for out of energy bills. The report explains that CCS can be done for about £16/megawatt hour, which is cheap, but commercial groups would only bid to do it for 4 times this price, which is why a £1Bn CCS plan was canned earlier in the year.  So it says government should do it.  Isn’t that nice – an industry group making the case for a nationalised industry?!  How times change…  And switching the gas grid to hydrogen is said to be a project on the same kind of scale as the smart meter rollout.

In a few paragraphs (61-64) the report dismisses the idea of an all-electric economy with winter heat pump heating, and explains that it’s cheaper to convert the gas grid to hydrogen to heat our homes, and explains that making hydrogen from natural gas and capturing the carbon is cheaper than making hydrogen from electricity.  That’s almost certainly true right now.  So, hey presto, this is THE proposal from the petrochemical industry.

But will it prevail?  It sweeps away many other proposals (e.g. CAT’s Zero Carbon Britain, Keith Barnham’s ’The Burning Answer’, Cameron’s ‘Biomass, Nuclear, Fracking’, The ’Solar Hydrogen Economy’ and more.  But given that this report was commissioned by Amber Rudd, and led by a big energy industry heavyweight, I’d say this is at pole position as the lead contender against nuclear – so we may have to grin and bear it.

A WORD OF CONSOLATION.

I’m a bit bowled over by this proposal.  I have been banging on about solar and hydrogen for some time, as to me the physics and chemistry makes most sense.  But I couldn’t see how the solar industry would ever persuade the government to switch the gas grid to hydrogen.  It would be a big extra cost to renewables.  But now here’s the petrochemical industry telling the government this is the way forward, and they are more likely to listen to bunch of people with ’Shell’ on their resumé, than with ‘CAT’ or ’solar junkie’ or whatever.  So here’s our hydrogen economy, through the front door.  Let’s smile.

One more thing.  Once we DO have a hydrogen gas grid, it does become very easy to inject hydrogen any where, any time, potentially.  All need is an open market, and open access to the grid – as we have for electricity.  And then see if Shell are right that they can make hydrogen cheaper than anyone else.  At the moment natural gas costs about 4 pence per kilowatt hour, and they are saying that CCS to get rid of the carbon dioxide will add at least another 1.6pence/unit.  That means the hydrogen has to cost at least 5.6 pence a unit even if catalytic reforming is 100% efficient.  Which it is not.

But neither is converting electricity to hydrogen by electrolysis – it’s only 60-70% efficient, and the round trip back to electricity again is only around 50% efficient ([says energystorage.org][21]).  Others are more sacthing – ‘[why a hydrogen economy doesn’t make sense][22] ‘ [phys.org][23]).  But gas turbine generators (40-60%) and petrol and diesel engines (20-40%) are as bad or worse.  By comparison, 50-70% efficient is not bad.  And what if we could make solar energy for quite alot less than 5.6 pence per unit?  We would have a solar hydrogen economy cheaper than a fossil hydrogen one – and with the hydrogen grid already in place.

*How cheap can solar go?*   In Chile, a new record low cost for solar electricity generation – [at 2.91¢/unit][24], a third cheaper than the International Energy Agency’s predicted best price for solar electricity in the year 2050 (their range is 4-16¢/unit).  But the IEA also predicts solar generating only 20% of our electricity by 2050.  But solar is growing exponentially – see below – and what is to stop that?  Certainly not the IEA.

[24]: http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/chile-breaks-dubais-record-of-solar-power-output-at-low-cost/articleshow/53932595.cms

on pricing – so far, when the amount of solar installed grows by a factor of ten, the cost halves, which helps it grow the next factor of ten.  Unfortunately there is only room for 2 or 3 more halvings in the cost of solar before we hit oversupply, around 2030 to 2032 – if straight line exponential forecasting works.  This will put the price of solar electricity at under 2p/unit for most people, meaning we get very cheap hydrogen.

To illustrate exponential growth, my first hard disk drive, 40 megabytes, cost £600.  An IEA forecast for my recent 8Tb drive would be £120,000,000, but it was £190 at Maplins.  Solar energy WILL get cheaper – but if all this new government does is steer away from nuclear energy towards a gas-fired hydrogen economy, that is a good transition step.  But if I hadn’t heard this news about CCS and a hydrogen grid, I’d be worried.

As it is, a hydrogen grid allows for disorderly ‘muddling through’ – and a steady exponential growth of solar – with hydrogen storage for excess summer PV to create our winter electricity and warmth – and the hydrogen grid conveniently provided by the fossil fuel industry before it fizzled out.  A decarbonised gas grid can’t stop the growth of solar PV – it makes gas more expensive, and hence solar more competitive.

These are first thoughts on a paper first seen only yesterday – anything can change – any physics could be trumped by political developments in the USA, and ensuing chaos.  Fingers crossed.  ;-)

Try this for size.  Undercurrents didn’t take much notice of solar PV, perhaps because it cost around $77,000 per kilowatt to install, around that time.  As we know, the price has fallen exponentially since then, and according to Wikipedia “_Worldwide growth of photovoltaics has been fitting an exponential curve for more than two decades_.”  But then “_Projections for photovoltaic growth are difficult and burdened with many uncertainties. Official agencies, such as the International Energy Agency consistently increased their estimates over the years, but still fell short of actual deployment_.”

So who do we believe, the physics and the graphs, or the IEA?  Looking at long term forecasts, “By 205, Fraunhofer expects LCOE for utility-scale solar farms to reach €0.02 to €0.04 per kilowatt-hour, or about half of what the International Energy Agency has been projecting (4¢ to 9.7¢). “  This compares interestingly with the best price this year for electricity from utility scale solar farms of $0.0291 (€0.0258) per kilowatt hour – which is at the low end of the Fraunhofer Institutes estimate for 2050, and well off the bottom of the scale of the IEA’s range – and only 34 years (THIRTY FOUR YEARS) earlier than either is predicting.  This suggests that governments are basing their decisions on data that is utterly wrong. No surprise there, of course, but why do we elect there people and pay them so much?  My temptation here is to go with the real data, and to recalibrate my forecast accordingly – i.e. ignore Fraunhofer and the IEA.  Switching deftly to look at the exponential forecasts, we see that Wikipedia has published the graph showing solar fitting an exponential curve – on a semilogarithmic axis, so it’s both easy to see the straight line, and to project forward…

**Wikipedia shows 20 years of growth of PV fits exponential growth.  Hard not to agree, unless you’re the IEA?**

![Exponential growth-curve on a semi-log scale, show a straight line since 1992][27]

**Here’s an extrapolation, using the best line I can draw that joins all the dots on the original line – fair enough?**

![Solar PV log linear growth](http://www.tilix.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/img/blogs/David-Saunders/Solar-PV-log-linear-growth.png)

The green dots correspond to 1% of world electricity demand and 100% respectively, and the upper red dot is where we hit 100% of total energy demand from the sun – around 2030 – as opposed to the IEA’s view that by 2050 we still less than a quarter of the way to just getting a quarter of our electricity from the sun.  Given two such widely divergent views, no wonder Theresa May is having to work overtime deciding on Hinckley C.

My interpretation of this graph, is that the next 15 years or so could be a lot of fun, and bring fulfilment to the dreams and aspirations of Undercurrents, Radical Technology, CAT, and many more.

And interestingly, according to Pete, we should be in the thick of the transition to an era of consciousness by then.  Maybe the [launch of u.lab 1x today][28] is part of that transition…

I meant to write a quick note of thanks after **Radical Technology Revisited**.  Instead it has turned into a bit of an essay – a personal reflection on what was, after all, a conference about the last forty years of my life and that of everyone else present.  I found it useful to write this review as a journaling exercise, and to think through the parts that I found most significant.  It seems to me that some of the comments I hard to the effect ‘not a lot has changed’ and ‘we were saying this 40 years ago’ may be masking changes that are happening exponentially, and already reaching or passing critical mass.  So thanks, and here’s my reflection…

Thanks for a really great, interesting and thought-provoking [Radical Technology Revisited][45] conference at the weekend.  I had lots of ‘aha’ moments at the conference, and learned a lot – and I’ve a couple of things to share that mix prescience (not mine) with hindsight – as Yogi Berra said “_It’s hard to make predictions – especially about the future._”  And as Peter Russell says “_When making predictions about the future we often unconsciously assume a linear growth pattern. If actual growth is exponential, then a given goal will be reached much sooner_.” ([in The Awakening Earth][46] / The Global Brain 1982).  See below…

**Solar Hydrogen Economy**
Peter Harper mentioned that RT did not make much mention of solar PV, and that the hydrogen economy still hasn’t take off.  But when RT was published, solar PV was impossibly expensive – even in 1977 [solar panels cost $70,000 per Kilowatt][47].  Yet in 1975, in ‘Energy, The Solar Hydrogen Alternative’, [John O’Mara Bockris][48] predicted we’d eventually have plentiful cheap solar energy – because the cost was dropping exponentially.  He was the world’s leading electrochemist, and explained that hydrogen from electrolysing water with cheap solar energy would provide energy storage at night, and for winter – our gas grids can store a winter’s worth of energy demand, so he proposed replace methane in our gas grids with hydrogen.  Few people understood the science so clearly – in 2000 at the World Expo in Hannover (in the ZERI – Zero Emission – Pavilion) I was saying solar PV was unsustainably costly – but by 2011 I was helping start a rooftop PV co-op in Bristol to explore community renewables – because the cost of solar PV was falling through the ‘grid parity’ barrier. ____

**Why Solar Hydrogen Trumps Fossil Energy.**
So, as of this weekend’s 40th anniversary conference we may be well over halfway to the solar hydrogen economy…  Just this last week, a power auction in [Chile announced bids to supply solar power at a record low of 2.2 pence (UK equivalent) per unit][49] – India Times (2.9 rupees = 2.2p).   That’s a lower wholesale price than electricity from any other source – at this price we can convert it to hydrogen and back again into electricity that will still cost less than the 4p/unit price of ’natural gas’ – methane – or our current wholesale price of electricity.  So both solar energy and the hydrogen economy are not just desirably renewable but financially viable.  And at these prices for mass generation and storage, there is no strong argument for building nuclear power stations – especially as the cost of solar will continue to fall exponentially from this record low – as the installations grow exponentially.  However, it’s all very well to say ‘Physics trumps politics’ – it’s another thing entirely to get politicians to understand physics – except in Germany, where the chancellor is a physicist.  ____

**Exponential Growth – the kick in the tail**
Even in 1995, solar PV was producing less than a thousandth of one percent of world electricity – and that was easy to ignore.  But as the Wikipedia article on Growth of photovoltaics says “Worldwide growth of photovoltaics has been fitting an exponential curve for more than two decades.” – and by 2014, only 19 years later, it had grown by three whole orders of magnitude and was supplying 1% of world electricity.  Two more orders of magnitude – in twelve years, maximum? – so by 2026 and we have 100% of world electricity demand from the sun.  The article struggles to balance this against official forecasts of 5000Gw of solar PV by 2050 – approximately 20% of our electricity – representing a factor of 20 growth in 24 years – or less than a third of the current growth rate.  Given that solar is cheaper now than everything except hydro power, it’s hard to explain the difference between exponential extrapolation and official estimates without invoking the utterly implausible argument that governments are being unduly influenced by the incumbent fossil fuel lobbies.

**Scenario Planning**
Of the scenarios considered at the weekend, these solar ideas fit best with ‘muddling through’, as little or no political action is needed.  I’d like to do a detailed comparison with other scenarios, but I suspect that the least cost, easiest to adopt solution that requires least political intervention is likely to ‘win’ (i.e. happen).  Whoever said that we are in a technocracy, not a democracy, hit the nail on the head – technologies like smartphones and services like Uber or Deliveroo, or Twitter or whatever – compete for our attention – growing exponentially, without political help – and all drifting in the direction of Jeremy Rifkin’s [Zero Marginal Cost Society][50].  So far, a generation of Internet companies (Amazon, Apple, Google, Uber, Deliveroo) are taking over from dinosaur industries.  Apple passes on 70¢ from a 99¢ music or software sale, which compares well with former 10% music industry royalties. As Jeremy Rifkin explains, the most likely scenario is the emergence of a global internet-based collaborative commons with nearly free goods and services that eclipses capitalism. Boo hoo.____

**Inner Technology / The Global Brain**
I was looking forward to the lunchtime session on Inner Technology, and itching to share an idea from Peter Russell’s The Global Brain.  What I hadn’t realised or remembered was that Peter had written the introduction, to this section – which I’ve been thrilled to [read on microfiche][51] (pp 234-7), however grainy.  Framing the section up, Paul Allen said that Pete’s article on Inner Technology was in some ways the most radical is it proposed ‘a metaparadigm shift’ … it is only if we really feel one with the world that we cannot imagine damaging it.  This mindset shift involved – to an “I and thou” relationship with nature rather than “I versus it” – would change everything – not just the technologies we’d want, but our need for technology.  And Pete notes that people are increasingly using techniques like meditation to experience unity, transcendence, directly.  By 1982 Pete had written the Awakening Earth (in USA The Global Brain), documenting [human activity shifting][52] from predominantly agricultural, to more than 50% involved in industry, and then moving on to information technology…

**The Metaparadigm Shift**
Peter predicted the wave beyond this in Radical Technology – a ‘metaparadigm shift’ to a time when the majority are involved directly in ‘psychotechnologies’ – technologies of thought and consciousness. When Radical Technology was written, the information age was in sight, but had not overtaken the industrial revolution.  It was 2011 before [Apple overtook Exxon][53] as the world’s most profitable company – ‘Think Different’ beat ‘Think Fossil’.  This is a total paradigm shift – information technology has given us the silicon for a solar revolution, and the software for smart grids that will power the planet sooner than most expect.  But Peter saw past the information age in 1976 to the next horizon – the Consciousness Era that’s emerging today.  For an update, here’s Pete framing up the October 2016 conference on Science and Nonduality, speaking in 2014 on [The Reality of Consciousness][54]. Incidentally, in a publishing quirk, this [waves of change][55] diagram in The Awakening Earth (p73), was omitted from the US version, The Global Brain – [here’s my updated version from 2000][56].

_“The changes that this will bring will be so great that their full impact may well be beyond our imagination.  No longer will we perceive ourselves as isolated individuals; we will perceive ourselves to be part of a rapidly integrating global network, the nerve cells of an awakening global brain.”_ – Peter Russell, The Awakening Earth, 1982.

**From Limits to Growth, to Awareness Based System Change**
The whole environmental movement was hugely informed by warnings like Rachel Carson’s 1962 book Silent Spring – it influenced me to switch from chemistry to computers, in order to avoid causing effects like DDT had.  And a decade later, Information Technology had evolved to the point where Jay Forrester’s group at MIT could model the world ecosystem, and produce the Limits to Growth report in 1972 for the Club of Rome – which strongly influenced Undercurrents and Radical Technology.  And if we fast forward the work at MIT – as we fast forwarded Radical Technologies this last weekend – their work has itself shifted from being on the cutting edge of Information Technology, to the cutting edge of the consciousness revolution – Jay Forrester’s work morphed into that of Ed Schein on organisational cultures; then Peter Senge on learning communities; Joe Jaworski on Presencing – and now Otto Scharmer with Theory U – which puts consciousness (as Pete predicted) at the foundation of the universe, and humanity, and ‘awareness based system change’.

**Leading from the Emerging Future**
Everything I have written above is directed towards noting a remarkable synchronicity, and to advocating that we take this last weekend’s conference as both milestone and springboard.  Otto Scharmer’s deep research on Theory U over the last 20 years at MIT has flowered into a MOOC (massive online course) called U.Lab that was tried out on 75,000 people in 2 sessions last year, with the biggest groups in the USA, China, and the new government of Scotland!  This year **u.lab **is launching fully with a 1½ hour introduction (**u.lab ox**) already online, and the main course (**u.lab 1x**) starting EXACTLY a week after Radical Technology Revisited. This is a remarkable coincidence. Pete Russell wrote in RT that we need a metaparadigm shift in order to be able to truly implement the visionary ideas presented in Undercurrents and RT as the solutions to an environmental crisis, and for humanity to live in harmony with nature.  At the weekend we saw that all the tools we need are now available and in place – but this shift to a one planet world still hasn’t quite managed to happen…

** – from Ego System to Ecosystem**
But the tipping point may just be a few days away.  With Otto Scharmer’s U.Lab course, communities around the world are being given the tools (the course is free) to make this shift.  More often than not, u.lab is being run out of community hubs, which are already involved in social change and the shift to a near ‘zero marginal cost society’ – and hence a near zero waste society too.  ‘Impact Hubs’ around the world are increasingly the focus of community-led innovation,and social enterprise start-ups, which are accelerating past our legacy corporations – the insurgency is beating the incumbency.  My feeling is that all this is a remarkable conjunction or juxtaposition – and far more synchrony than coincidence.  I wanted to draw it to your attention, as well as to circulate the thoughts above – about exponential solar, and the fulfilment of the ideas in Undercurrents and RT – and how the metaparadigm shift is accelerating with u.labs, and can speed the spread of ideas from pioneering hubs like CAT in Wales, Findhorn in Scotland, and Coexist in Bristol.   Enjoy…

**So – thanks again for a great event this last weekend.  The rest of this email is what I put together to invite colleagues and others to join in the u.lab course that’s starting this coming Friday…**____

**INVITATION TO U.LAB 0x and 1x…**
_I took the **u.lab** course last year, along with at least 20 others in Bristol, and 75,000 worldwide.  I was challenged, I learned a lot – and I joined a coaching circle that has helped me through challenges, and helped me connect better with myself and others.  I can’t imagine anything more likely to help us work together to deliver Bristol’s Community Strategy for Energy and other Green Capital Goals – for Bristol and beyond…

**_TIMING_**:  **u.lab 1.x** starts on September 8th, with the first live session on 15th – they sometimes stretch the sign-up deadline, but ‘time is of the essence’.  **[You can register for u.lab 1x already][57].**

**_u.lab 1x and its introduction u.lab 0x are free_**.  A new, hour-and-a-half introductory course [**u.labs 0x launched on August 15**][58] – ‘Leading Awareness-Based Systems Change - How to Sense and Actualize the Future’.  It’s available already – and ongoing.  It’s a prerequisite to the full u.lab 1.x course, and a great introduction.  Both u.lab 0x and u.lab 1x are free, but you can pay a few dollars and get a certification.

**_Testimonial. _**_ I’m talking **u.lab** again this year, and hope many others will participate  – join u.labs and help build a critical mass of people upgrading their operating system to ‘uOS’ – highly recommended.
