title: "Adding EVs to the DSM mix"
---
The economics of EV ownership has reached the tipping point, and now the LCOE of an EV undercuts their comparable fossil fuel car. We can expect that the numbers of vehicles on the road will only increase, which is good news!

 There has been some shortsighted proposals recently, suggesting that EVs will cause the electricity system to collapse.  Far from it, we are already seeing signs that the system is becoming more volatile in pricing, and the rewards for being flexible with your consumption are only going to increase.

Suggestions that EVs should only be charged overnight is overlooking the fact that there are increasing times when the grid is oversupplied during the day. For example, this year in the UK there are 4 predicted days when the output from unconstrained solar will exceed overall demand and we need somewhere to put this energy. Hence the rise of smart charging controllers that will monitor the status of the grid (local and national), and either charge when there is an excess, or in V2G trials, enable power to be exported in times of short supply!

We need enlightened pricing structures that make the most of modern ITC to capitilise on system imbalance, but this will provide a system damping effect rather than making it worse. Simple physics.
