Overview of [marine energy][4] leading into review of 4 illustrative organisations & projects:

- [EMEC][1]
- [Simply Blue][2]
- [Swansea Tidal Lagoon][3]
- [MeyGen][4]

## MeyGen tidal turbine
A new world record has been set by MeyGen’s 6MW tidal turbine system during its first phase for the monthly production of energy. This record has been noted by Atlantis developers, and has been backed by the company who confirmed on the 1st September that the tidal turbine had indeed generated nearly 2GWh from its spot off the coast of Caithness after production started just a month prior. In August, Atlantis also stated that they had set the world record for monthly production from their tidal stream power station, reaching over 700MWh in just that month.

The director of project delivery, David Taaffe, stated that, “August proved to be a world record month, providing enough energy to power 2,000 Scottish homes from just two turbines.” He also believes the record breaking achievements will not stop there, declaring that the Atlantis operations team’s success on this campaign is only the beginning, and his predictions in regards to this incredible world record is that the company will “continue to break records throughout the rest of the year generating both predictable power and revenue.”

David Taaffe is not the only person who has high expectations of MeyGen’s tidal turbine system; Scottish Renewables’ policy manager, Hannah Smith, also stated that the Pentland Firth has the most powerful tides flowing through it than “anywhere on earth”. She believes that harnessing the power from these tides has pushed technology to further any preconceptions of its limits, utilising machines and skills “which have never before been tested on a commercial scale”. Smith believes that the MeyGen project’s most recent record isn’t going to be their last, as they are becoming world leaders in tidal energy creation, having demonstrated their determination to discover new, smarter ways to generate power by stretching their intellect and resources, therefore furthering their progress, and continuing to achieve higher successes in energy production.
