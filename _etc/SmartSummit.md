The SmartSummit event that took place in London on the 19th and 20th September this year offered valuable insights into the future of smart energy, the opportunities forged by IoT, the effects of AI on the current Utilities market and much more. 

The talks and the panels that day absolutely solidified how that the future of energy is rapidly changing. With the hashtag for the event ‘#smartsummit17’ on the social media platform of Twitter, it seems that the entire world has an opinion of their own on the future of smart energy. But who answered the extremely valuable questions as well as gave the best insights into the cost and effectivity of smart energy?

  One user, Keri McCool asked the million pound question, tweeting, “Now for the big question... can smart home products really save the consumers money?”It was the panel of professionals in this industry that debated the issues of the smart home, and how individuals can save energy with their own smart home during the talk ‘Bringing New Approaches to Energy Saving in the Smart Home’. This panel featured a range of professionals including Dominique Bertin; the Smart Energy Applications Manager from EDF Energy, Gethyn Friswell; the Connected Home Manager from ENGIE, Dominic Lavelle; the Head of Product & Proposition from RWE npower, Stuart Ravens; a Principal Analyst from Navigant and Miguel Sanchez, the CEO of Momit. Another highly debated question emerged, on the subject of apps in the smart home. Adam Simon posted on Twitter after the discussion, “Is there a killer app in the smart home? Panel do not think so. Voice control not exactly an app has changed things big time.”  

There was also a side focus on not just smart homes, but smart cities, and how smart energy within cities could be a huge addition to the lives of future generations. On Twitter, Becky Ledger gave us her own thoughts on what she had gathered from the talks, explaining that no two smart cities will be the same, after debating hyper local solutions to smart energy within larger urban areas. Johan Ander, the Business Development Director for Fortum Technology and New Ventures who specialises in Smart Homes, Smart Cities and IoT led the talk ‘How IoT Will Change How People Use Energy - New Business Opportunities’ and it most certainly raised a number of questions. One of them was whether IoT can be trusted, and how easily it can be used; Twitter user Jonny Voon asked a very important rhetorical question by stating that the “future of IoT relies on dynamic, flexible, accessible and secure systems. If no one can use or trust it, what's the point?”  

Arguably this was answered by a tweet from Abhi Bhargava, who quoted one of the speakers from a panel on Smart Cities, “’We have to create services out of the vast amount of data'. Engagement with public is vital for smart... everything!” So perhaps it is the feedback from the public that will really impact which direction smart energy will go in next.
