## Health, Safety and Environment Management 
Tilix employs less than 5 employees, so are not legally obliged to have written health, safety and environment policies. However, we deem health and safety for our employees and contractors to be of highest priority and importance and have a [short HSE policy statement](hse.html).

Our HSE considerations are mostly about office and travel safety. Tilix applies the customs and practice it has adopted in recent projects for Telefonica, Capita and National Grid. For example, with National Grid we have recently worked at 400kV substations. It was encouraging to find that Tilix custom and practice aligned naturally with National Gridâ€™s world class safety procedures

## Privacy and Data Protection
Tilix uses its decades of experience in IT management to keep the data secure and provide access in a controlled fashion, following the golden rule of least privilege.

Tilix has previously delivered excellence in privacy management and meeting all applicable legal requirements. For example, we have undertaken leadership roles around the websites of Royal Mail, Post Office and Parcel Force during the time when the current cookie legislation came into place. As senior interim IT management at Ovo and Good Energy, data protection and privacy were major concerns for customer information systems, call centres and digital channels.
