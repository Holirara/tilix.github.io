## New Entrants
New players in the energy market often have stringent technology and regulatory requirements to meet. TILIX. helps with tailored solutions that span planning, deployment, operations and business optimisation.
### Challenging the Big 6
There is an increasing number of new entrants in the GB energy supply market. Some of the key drivers behind this are:

  * Growing dissatisfaction with the Big 6.
  * Good success stories from challengers.
  * Policy interventions to promote competition.
  * Renewables reducing barriers to entry in generation.
  * Smart tech enabling disruptive business models.

However, the energy supply business remains highly technical and subject to sophisticated regulation. Therefore, prudent new entrants seek expert advice at an early stage.
