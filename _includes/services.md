## ENERGY SERVICES
TILIX. applies systems thinking to improve energy efficiency in industry, transport and the built environment. We offer solutions around energy audits, procurement, storage, demand response, smart buildings, connected living and electric vehicle infrastructure.

### Saving Gigabucks with Negawatts_
We believe that most utility customers donâ€™t want kilowatt-hours of electricity or therms of gas.

Rather they want energy services such as hot showers, cold beer, lit rooms, and spinning shafts, which can become cheaper and more effective if energy is used intelligently. 

[Please reach out to TILIX.][1] if you would like to see energy behaviours changed for good in your organisation. 

TILIX. provides energy management expertise to clients nationally and internationally to help reduce bills, optimise local generation and leverage energy storage. 

At Commercial and Industrial scale, TILIX. demand side management (DSM) can help create revenue streams from grid balancing incentives. 

For organisations of any size, TILIX. can imporve the bottom line with services including audits, brokerage, smart building design and electric vehicle fleet management.

## NEW ENTRANTS
New players in the energy market often have stringent technology and regulatory requirements to meet. TILIX. helps with tailored solutions that span planning, deployment, operations and business optimisation.
### Challenging the Big 6
There is an increasing number of new entrants in the GB energy supply market. Some of the key drivers behind this are:

  * Growing dissatisfaction with the Big 6.
  * Good success stories from challengers.
  * Policy interventions to promote competition.
  * Renewables reducing barriers to entry in generation.
  * Smart tech enabling disruptive business models.

However, the energy supply business remains highly technical and subject to sophisticated regulation. Therefore, prudent new entrants seek expert advice at an early stage.
