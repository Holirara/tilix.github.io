TILIX. is rising to the challenge of making cheap, clean and cheerful energy. In other words, we are finding answers to the Energy Trilemma:
                   
* Can we have energy that is secure and does not cost the earth?
* Are we creating and using energy in the most efficient way?
* Can "the system" be trusted to do the right thing, now and in the future?

We know that the stone age ended before we ran out of stones. TILIX. is optimistic that our energy crisis will be solved before fossil fuels run out.
