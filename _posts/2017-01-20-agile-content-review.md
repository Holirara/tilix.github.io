Tilix works hard to stay on top of a large and ever increasing body of knowledge. This helps us get inspired and learn from business, academia, research and government. 

Transforming the whole energy system requires huge amounts of creative re-thinking. Engaging with a wide range of content from many different stakeholders is an important part of the mix.

Our knowledge management approach works on two horizons:

1. On an ongoing basis we have well established routines for staying inspired through our life-long learning study plans. This is very much in tune with this [Accidental Creative Podcast][7]
2. For short bursts of focussed activity, we have developed an approach with techniques borrowed from agile software engineering.

This post outlines the latter by describing how Tilix applies iterations, story points, burndown etc to review a body of content. This approach could apply to a single piece e.g. a blog or whitepaper. However, it better suited for larger batches of content.

## Mission
The mission is to avoid drowning or burying our heads in the sand. Put another way, the goal is to systematically drink water from the proverbial fire hydrant [Mitch Kapoor]. 

We do this to get inspiration and information from business, academia, research and government. Inspiration and information are vital ingredients for getting things done ....[David Allen]

## Guiding Principles
Through publications and social networking, Tilix accesses a vast array of reports, analytics, modelling and likeminded people. To avoid drowning we have developed our people, processes and technologies to work together as outlined in this post.

Some of the advantages of this socio-technical approach are that we can maintain perspective and control. The key benefit is that the processes and technologies, rather than constraining us, provides freedom to learn and gain new insights.

Our interests span a broad range of topics that are playing key roles in the emerging future of energy. We has a keen eye for business ideas from entrepreneurs and start-ups. In doing so we leverage our broad appreciation of the global energy economy and our deep understanding of the technologies, networks and institutions which enable energy services to be delivered to families, small businesses, commercial premises and industry.

Our default position is to look on the content from the viewpoint of a shrewd investor. Tilix’s shrewd investor viewpoint is built upon a body of knowledge within the technology and venture capitalist communities. In particular we are finding that the methods of Geoffrey Moore – the well-known Silicon Valley VC – can be readily applied to the transformation of the whole energy system.

![Geoffrey Moore][1]

In addition to knowledge management and investing, Tilix embraces the following mantras:

1.	__Holding the space:__ listen to your higher self, listen to others and make sure that there is space where people can talk.
2.	__Observing:__ keep your mind wide open and get rid of your voice of judgment.
3.	__Sensing:__ Connecting our hearts and looking for interconnected wholes.
4.	__Presencing:__ Acting from the emerging whole.
5.	__Crystallizing:__ Accessing the power of intention 
6.	__Prototyping:__ act lean and fail fast
7.	__Performing:__ Understanding how to scale from prototypes to fully deployed and optimised solutions

## Approach
Our knowledge management processes and technology comprises techniques and toolchains from Lean Startup, social media and digital communications. Together these have helped Tilix to identify and engage with progressive thinking and doing within the global energy system.

![Techniques & Toolchain][2]

When faced with a large body of content to work through in a short period of time, we first reflect on

* **Why?**
* **What?**
* **Brainstorming**
* **Mind Mapping & Kanban**
* **Actions**

From there we can assess how close our knowledge management system fits around the requirement. Having identified the gaps, we can tune to the specific requirements of the _knowledge owner_. 

Regular discussion between the _knowledge owner_ and the research team is encouraged. Slack is better than email, conversations are often better than writing and face to face meetings are important.

In the mind map, content does not need a business case or estimates. Typically all that is needed is a title, short description and a URL. Since the investment of effort on items in this queue is minor, the queue is not WIP-limited. All ideas are captured for consideration. Content is promoted into the Kanban on a periodic basis.

Building on the principles from agile software development, the team sizes the work using planning poker and report progress using burn-down charts.

For example, the table below shows the story points for a small body of knowledge on the topic of homepage design.

| Content |Size  |Complexity  |Value  |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|

Team concurrence on story points is achieved using planning poker. Each piece of content is scored for size, complexity and perceived value.

This is the capture state, where all options are welcome. Once content has been sized it enters "the funnel" (state 0) to be progressed through the following states.

1. **Quick Look** - In this state the preliminary estimates for value and complexity are established.
2. **Analysis** - This is where the more thorough work is done to understand the content. A lightweight review form is completed. 
3. **Synthesis** - After analysis content is ready to be pulled by the _knowledge owner_ into her new content e.g. meta-analysis, slide deck, report, blog.
4. **Done** – Content can transition from each of the earlier states to done if certain criteria are met. from the funnel to synthesis.

To progress from one stage to the next, some standard work needs to be done. 

Content that reaches the quick look queue warrants further investment of time. In this queue, an estimate of value is established. Time investment is controlled to the "water cooler" discussion level, with perhaps some very preliminary investigation. The content is described as per the tables below. Since the investment is increasing, this queue is WIP-limited to curtail the number of active items in process. Sources of business benefit are identified and items are prioritised. The example output from a quick look at a blog page:

**Content Position Statement**

|:--|:--|
| **For** | _a persona_ |
|  **who** | _want something_ |
|  **this** | _name the content type_ |
|  **is a** | _wax lyrical about the content_ |
|  **that** | _identify stakeholder concerns addressed_ |
|  **unlike** | _compare with other content in the backlog_ |

**Scope**

|:--|:--|
| **Success Criteria:** | .... |
| **Focus on:** | .... |
| **Skim:** | .... |
| **Ignore:** | .... |

Some content only warrants a quick look. When a detailed look is required.......

To track and communicate progress, we maintain charts like:

![Kanban using Meister Task][3]

![Burndown Chart][4]

![Cumulative Flow][5]

## Work Package Organization
The work always has a _knowledge owner_. This is synonymous with the product owner in Scrum or the project sponsor in PRINCE 2 etc. 

The team typically comprises a domain expert and research assistant(s) and their work is phased as follows:

1.	__Inception:__ Verify the high-level requirements of the knowledge owner. Where appropriate, collect content.
2.	__Elaboration:__ Verify the technical approach & elicit specific requirements. Size the work and agree cadence.
3.	__Analysis:__ Deep listening to the identified body of knowledge.
4.	__Synthesis:__ Summarising findings in a short form (e.g. a slide deck or report).
5.	__Transition:__ Discuss with knowledge owner. Capture lessons learnt & agree future work

## Inception
The goal of the inception phase is to get the work off to a good start. This (necessarily) should not require a great deal of effort. However, it can take up quite a bit of calendar time as it can involve waiting for decisions. The key activities are:

* Confirm scope and boundary conditions for the work. 
* Where necessary, adjust the work package organisation to meet with stakeholder expectations.
* Confirm how progress will be communicated.
