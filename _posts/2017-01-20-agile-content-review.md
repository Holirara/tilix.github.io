Tilix works hard to stay on top of a large and ever increasing body of knowledge. This helps us get inspired and learn from business, academia, research and government. 

Transforming the whole energy system requires huge amounts of creative re-thinking. Engaging with a wide range of content from many different stakeholders is an important part of the mix.

The Tilix approach to knowledge management works on two horizons:

1. On an ongoing basis we have well established routines for staying inspired through our life-long learning study plans. This is very much in tune with this [Accidental Creative Podcast][7]
2. For short bursts of focussed activity, we have developed an approach with techniques borrowed from agile software engineering.

This post outlines the second horizon and describes how Tilix iterations, story points, burndown etc to support structured content reviews. This approach best suited for batches of content but can apply to a single piece e.g. a blog or whitepaper.

## Goal
Content is a source of inspiration and information. Engaging appropriately with it helps us get things done and create value for our selves, our customers and society. Borrowing a metaphor from Mitch Kapoor, the objective is to:

>quickly, efficiently and effectively drink water from the fire hydrant that is the body of knowledge from business, academia, research and government. 

## Guiding Principles
Through events and social networks we connect with likeminded people and are inspired by their ideas, opinions and points of view. The Internet gives us easy access to a vast array of reports, analytics and modelling. 

To avoid drowning we have evolved our people, processes and technologies as outlined in this post. This socio-technical approach gives us perspective and control. Rather than constraining us, the processes and technologies provides freedom to learn and gain new insights.

Our principle interest is the emerging future of energy. First we take a broad view of the global energy economy. Then we take deeper looks at the technologies, networks and institutions which deliver energy services.

Building on ideas from the technology and venture capitalist communities, our viewpoint is somewhat like a shrewd investor. Our favourite guru is Geoffrey Moore, the well-known Silicon Valley venture capitalist.

Having an open mind and open heart is critical. Therefore, Tilix embraces [Theory U][0] and has the following mantras at the core of its approach to reviewing content:

- __Hold the Space:__ Listen to your higher self and make room in your heart for other people's ideas and opinions.
- __Observe:__ Keep your mind wide open. Do not listen to your voice of judgment.
- __Sense:__ Look for interconnected wholes.
- __Presence:__ Act from the emerging whole.
- __Crystallize:__ Access the power of intention as the 
- __Prototype:__ Take notes as you consume the content or have time to reflect on it.
- __Perform:__ Synthesise new content from what you've learnt.

## Approach
Tilix leverages techniques and toolchains from Lean Startup, social media and digital communications. Used together in a highly cohesive system, these help Tilix to identify and engage with progressive thinking and doing within the global energy system.

When faced with a large body of content to work through in a short period of time, the first action is to quickly run through our standard approach to planning: 

1. **Ask Why?**: Laying out a goal for the content review is a common sense place to start.
2. **Identify What?**: Starting with the end in mind, picture the best possible outcome of the work.
3. **Think About How**: Brainstorm and collect ideas. This could be an internal process for small jobs, but most times *mind mappping* is a useful technique
4. **Organise Everything**: Layout the different components of the project and think about sequencing and priorities.
5. **Agree Next Actions**: Get concurrence on the specific tasks needed to get started.

Most times, our goal here is to get the team to agree their next action. From there, we can assess how close our knowledge management system fits around the requirement. Having identified the gaps, we can tune to the specific requirements of the _knowledge owner_. 

Typically, the review project will look similar to the Portfolio Kanban from Scaled Agile Framework:

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lReLajr3tBc/URg7-Kj3ysI/AAAAAAAAABo/jTTaVb0kIoU/s1600/portfolio+kanban.png)

Regular discussion between the _knowledge owner_ and the research team is encouraged. Slack is better than email, conversations are often better than writing and face to face meetings are important.

In getting started it is important to remember that content does not need a business case or estimates to enter the backlog. Typically all that is needed is a title, short description and a URL. Since the investment of effort on items in this queue is minor, the queue is not WIP-limited. All ideas are captured for consideration. Content is promoted into the Kanban on a periodic basis.

The table below shows the story points for a small body of knowledge on the topic of homepage design.

Team concurrence on story points is achieved using planning poker. Each piece of content is scored for size, weight (i.e. complexity) and perceived value.

This is the capture state, where all options are welcome. Once content has been sized it enters "the funnel" (state 0) to be progressed through the following states.

1. **Quick Look** - In this state the preliminary estimates for value and complexity are established.
2. **Analysis** - This is where the more thorough work is done to understand the content. A lightweight review form is completed. 
3. **Synthesis** - After analysis content is ready to be pulled by the _knowledge owner_ into her new content e.g. meta-analysis, slide deck, report, blog.
4. **Done** – Content can transition from each of the earlier states to done if certain criteria are met. from the funnel to synthesis.

Content that reaches the quick look queue warrants further investment of time. In this queue, an estimate of value is established. Time investment is controlled to the "water cooler" discussion level, with perhaps some very preliminary investigation. Content can be described as per the templates below. Since the investment is increasing, this queue is WIP-limited to curtail the number of active items in process. Sources of business benefit are identified and items are prioritised.

**Content Position Statement**

|:--|:--|
| **For** | _a persona_ |
|  **who** | _want something_ |
|  **this** | _name the content type_ |
|  **is a** | _wax lyrical about the content_ |
|  **that** | _identify stakeholder concerns addressed_ |
|  **unlike** | _compare with other content in the backlog_ |

**Scope**

|:--|:--|
| **Success Criteria:** | .... |
| **Focus on:** | .... |
| **Skim:** | .... |
| **Ignore:** | .... |

The example output from a quick look at [B2B Usability][104]:

**For**	a small business owner, marketing professional or UX pro,  
**who is**  

1. Evaluating their own home page 
2. Evaluating competing home pages
3. Planning a home page development
4. Executing a home page development 

**this**	averaged sized blog post  
**is a**	systematic review of cross-sector trends in the rate of change in homepages  
**that**	is written by a global authority in web usability  
**unlike** some other authors, Nielsen is scientific and provides good references.

**Success Criteria:**  

- We can put the conclusions into perspective for Tilix and our clients
- We understand the approach used by Jacob Nielsen.  

**Focus on:** 

- Imagining how we could repeat Nielsen's review process in a before and after review of a homepage redesign project  

**Skim:**	The screen shot examples as these are quite dated  
**Ignore:**	Nothing! It looks like an excellent article top to bottom.

Some content only warrants a quick look. When a detailed look is required the format of the review note could look like:

To track and communicate progress, we maintain charts like:

## Work Package Organization
The work always has a _knowledge owner_. This is synonymous with the product owner in Scrum or the project sponsor in PRINCE 2 etc. 

The team typically comprises a domain expert and research assistant(s) and their work is phased as follows:

1.	__Inception:__ Verify the high-level requirements of the knowledge owner. Where appropriate, collect content.
2.	__Elaboration:__ Verify the technical approach & elicit specific requirements. Size the work and agree cadence.
3.	__Analysis:__ Deep listening to the identified body of knowledge.
4.	__Synthesis:__ Summarising findings in a short form (e.g. a slide deck or report).
5.	__Transition:__ Discuss with knowledge owner. Capture lessons learnt & agree future work

## Inception Tasks
The goal of the inception phase is to get the work off to a good start. This (necessarily) should not require a great deal of effort. However, it can take up quite a bit of calendar time as it can involve waiting for decisions. The key activities are:

* Confirm scope and boundary conditions for the work. 
* Where necessary, adjust the work package organisation to meet with stakeholder expectations.
* Confirm how progress will be communicated.
