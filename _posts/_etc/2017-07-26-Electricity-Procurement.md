title: "Electricity procurement for small suppliers"    
---
At the time of writing, 118 organisations hold supply licences (69 for the domestic and non-domestic customers and 49 for non-domestic customers only). However, the market is dominated by the Big Six (British Gas, EDF Energy, E.ON, RWE npower, ScottishPower and SSE), which between them supply 99 per cent of domestic customers. These companies are vertically integrated, producing much of the electricity sold by their supply businesses. Other suppliers without their own generation, must find other means of meeting their electricity needs.

Although wholesale electricity costs are declining as a proportion of total consumer bills, they remain both an important source of cost and an important means of price differentiation for suppliers: in a world where network and environmental/social costs are both growing and increasingly difficult to manage, an effective electricity procurement strategy can be a means to increased price competitiveness.

# Procurement alternatives

Aside from simply buying electricity in the cash-out market, which is unpredictable and can quickly become expensive, suppliers have three means of procuring electricity: (i) through a third-party platform; (ii) directly from the wholesale markets; (iii) directly from generators; or some combination of (ii) and (iii). The alternatives involve making trade-offs between control and flexibility against upfront and operating costs, but in each case it is essential that appropriate governance frameworks are established to ensure risks are appropriately managed and costs are controlled.

## Using a third-party platform

Suppliers can access the wholesale electricity markets via a third-party platform. This avoids the need for bilateral agreements with counterparties, simplifying administrative processes. Third-party platform providers can also manage some of the regulatory requirements associated with market trading, such as REMIT and MIFID notifications, however diligence is required to ensure services are being adequately delivered and that they continue to offer value for money.

A number of third parties provide small and new entrant suppliers with access to trading platforms as a means of accessing wholesale electricity markets. A key benefit of such arrangements is the ability to offer products with the size and shape required by the supplier  " something that may be difficult for them to achieve directly. Some providers also offer reduced collateral requirements which can provide a significant working capital benefit.

The supplier receives a "one-stop-shop" with all their trading needs accommodated in one place, avoiding the need for:

  * Multiple bilateral agreements with counterparties;
  * Separate credit and collateral requirements with counterparties and exchanges;
  * Reduced internal regulatory and compliance obligations as aspects of REMIT and MIFID can be delivered by the third party; and a
  * Reduced need for internal imbalance management as the third party can settle imbalances on the supplier"s behalf.

Such third-party agreements can also be flexed to accommodate any direct purchases from generators made by the supplier.

Suppliers still need to determine their trading requirements, providing the third party with volume profiles and any price targets or limits it may have, and providing volume forecasts at agreed intervals.

As such arrangements involve placing significant dependence on third parties, so suppliers need to establish appropriate controls for monitoring the performance of the agreement. This will ensure all services are delivered as agreed, and that settlements are accurate and regulatory obligations met. It will also ensure that the arrangement continues to deliver value for money. Credit monitoring is also important, both in terms of working capital management, but also with respect to the third-party provider, since if the provider were to cease trading the consequences for the supplier could be significant.

## Purchasing from the market

Suppliers can buy electricity in the wholesale markets. This can be through bilateral "over-the-counter" (OTC) contracts or on an exchange, although most transactions occur bilaterally where buyers and sellers agree terms for bespoke transactions. Unlike PPAs the power is not associated with any specific asset and there are no operational implications other than general shipper balancing obligations.

![](http://www.tilix.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/img/blogs/Electricity-Procurement/image002.gif)

A range of instruments is traded in the market, over different time horizons as illustrated above, allowing suppliers to fine-tune their volume needs and manage price risk. Bilateral agreements can be more flexible than trading on exchange, allowing the possibility for bespoke terms (including credit). Typically such contracts are executed under a Master Agreement such as an EFET, or Grid Trade Master Agreement (less commonly, electricity may be traded as a financial product ie without physical settlement, under an ISDA Master Agreement).

There has been a trend in recent years towards standardisation of OTC products, with trading taking place on platforms such as Trayport which connect market participants (utilities, corporates, banks, brokers, fund managers and trading houses) with each other and with cleared exchanges.

A direct market trading activity can involve significant operational requirements in terms of trading and risk systems, and separated teams to carry out front office (trading), middle office (risk management) and back office (settlements) functions. Compliance teams are needed to ensure that all regulatory obligations are met and market rules followed, and legal and credit teams are needed to negotiate master agreements with counterparties.

Collateral management is often key for smaller suppliers where managing working capital can be more critical. Collateral is required by Elexon, by exchanges, and often by counterparties.

Transaction costs must also be considered by market participants. Contracts in the wholesale markets are traded at a spread to the mid-price, known as the bid-offer spread:

  * Buyers pay the offer price and sellers receive the bid price, so the bid-offer spread represents a transaction cost for suppliers purchasing electricity in the wholesale market;
  * The size of the bid-offer spread varies with liquidity, with more liquid products having narrower spreads and less liquid products having wider spreads. This increases the costs of trading in less liquid products.

![](http://www.tilix.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/img/blogs/Electricity-Procurement/image003.gif)

As the charts above illustrate, transaction costs are higher for less liquid instruments. There have been significant improvements in recent years in bid-offer spreads for the more liquid baseload products, however spreads for peakload products are highe, particularly at longer tenors.

## Buying directly from generators

Suppliers can buy directly from generators under Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). These are tied to a specific asset and generally involve the entire output of the asset. Suppliers can access "green" energy from renewable generation, or can buy power from conventional power stations, with access to the balancing mechanism and ancillary services provision.

![](http://www.tilix.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/img/blogs/Electricity-Procurement/image004.gif)

In its simplest form, a PPA is simply an agreement for the purchase of power at an agreed price or price reference, however it is usual for PPAs to include both gain sharing arrangements and some degree of operational and risk sharing. Power purchase agreements may have a variety of forms depending on the nature of the underlying asset " primarily whether it"s a new-build project or existing plant, and whether it is transmission or distribution connected.

  * New-build PPAs can have long maturities (10-year deals are common), however there is less appetite these days for fixed price structures or price floors, and these would only be offered for shorter periods if at all.
  * Income and risk-sharing arrangements are determined by the location of the asset in the system:

    - For transmission-connected assets the off-taker may make dispatching decisions and enter the asset into the balancing and ancillary services markets, as well as managing balancing risks;

    - For distribution-connected assets the off-taker might manage dispatch to exploit embedded benefits.

It is essential to ensure that the specific principles of the activities and risk-sharing are properly defined, and that the benefits can be audited to ensure gains are distributed appropriately. Appropriate IT systems capable of managing complex settlement processes are required.

### Corporate PPAs

Corporate PPAs are PPA transactions between a generator and a corporate end-user " generally a company with large electricity procurement needs. The motivation for these transactions is often for the corporate buyer to be able to source renewable energy directly.

![](http://www.tilix.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/img/blogs/Electricity-Procurement/image005.gif)

As the corporate buyer is unlikely to be either physically connected to the generating asset, or a signatory to the Balancing & Settlements Code, a BSC Party or Licenced Supplier is needed to manage the physical market operations of the arrangements. The corporate buyer enters into a direct PPA with the generator, and a back-to-back or "sleeved" PPA with the supplier.

Longer fixed price durations can be possible than for wholesale PPAs, but the creditworthiness of the buyer is key, particularly if the PPA is being used to support the project finance for the asset.

![](http://www.tilix.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/img/blogs/Electricity-Procurement/image006.gif)

Direct or private wires PPAs are a particular type of corporate PPA where the generator has a physical connection both to the customer through private wires, and to the grid. A direct physical connection between the generator and the corporate buyer saves on grid costs, although the upfront capex costs are higher, and connections greater than a few kilometres become prohibitively expensive.

A parallel PPA arrangement is required with a licenced supplier to deal with surplus volumes not required by the customer, and also so the supplier can act as a back-stop buyer in the event the customer becomes unable to fulfil its obligations under its PPA (otherwise the generation plant would have to stop operating).

The electricity price achieved by the generator is typically higher than for either wholesale or sleeved PPAs, but the process of implementing the transaction is complex: requirements include a willingness on the part of the parties to enter into complex arrangements with high transaction costs, the customer must be credit worthy, the physical location must be suitable for the direct connection to be made, the co-operation of local DNO/TSO is needed for backstop arrangements as there must be sufficient capacity on local grid to take full offtake if needed.

# Managing price risk and working capital are essential to success

All BSC Parties are responsible for balancing their electricity position in each half-hourly settlement period. This can be complex when managing the output of intermittent assets whose generation can be difficult to predict - market participants typically have back-office teams responsible for internal reconciliation of Elexon statements which describe their imbalance position in each settlement period.

![](http://www.tilix.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/img/blogs/Electricity-Procurement/image007.gif)

Imbalance costs are unpredictable, with no particular pattern " costs peak at different levels, during different settlement periods, from one day to the next. The best way to avoid these unpredictable costs is to maintain as close to a balanced position as possible in each settlement period. For this reason, suppliers often subscribe to weather forecasts in order to predict the output from renewable generation assets, enabling them to trade in the market in order to meet expected shortfalls or offload surpluses prior to gate closure.

Suppliers also need to consider market price risks in their portfolio. Where suppliers can achieve perfect pass-through of costs to customers, there is no need for hedging, however this is unusual, in practice, most suppliers are exposed to price and should consider implementing a hedging strategy.

![](http://www.tilix.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/img/blogs/Electricity-Procurement/image008.gif)

Understanding exposure to rising prices across the trading horizon, and determining the level of acceptable risk is key as managing volume risk poorly can result in both trading losses and increased balancing costs. The chart above shows how prices can suddenly spike, but it is interesting to consider the flatter periods: even here day-to-day price fluctuations are of the order of 10-15%, which is a large amount for a key part of the cost base to be moving around.

Typical hedging strategies involve rolling programmes of hedges, with higher coverage in the near term and lower coverage further along the trading horizon. By far the most common product-types traded in the GB electricity market are forwards (or for exchange-based trading, futures) - options products are also available but are generally less liquid and available over shorter tenors.

![](http://www.tilix.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/img/blogs/Electricity-Procurement/image009.gif)

Failure to manage price risks can have disastrous consequences. The bankruptcy of GB Energy Supply in November 2016 was in part due to poor management of price risks. According to [Cornwall Energy][10], GB Energy Supply was not trading particularly badly, but it could not access the products needed to effectively manage risk in an environment of more volatile cash-out prices following the reforms to imbalance pricing the previous year. In particular, it struggled to access liquidity in blocks 5 and 6.

"The last time we had a very volatile market in 2005 there were ten small suppliers, and only three were still around at the end of it."

## Small suppliers have a number of procurement alternatives, but appropriate governance is vitally important

New entrant suppliers are rightly focused on building their customer offers and growing market share, but the electricity procurement choices they make can mean the difference between competitive advantage and business failure.

![](http://www.tilix.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/img/blogs/Electricity-Procurement/image010.gif)

Building a full-scale trading platform that enables full access to wholesale markets provides significant flexibility, but requires major investments in systems and processes, and the creation of full front, middle and back-office functions. It can also be difficult for small suppliers to trade the shape they need as their volume requirements may be below usual market size for such transactions.

Use of third party platforms can reduce (but not eliminate) this upfront requirement. Suppliers can leverage the platform developed by the third party, and avoid much of the upfront cost, and in some cases reduce their working capital needs through attractive collateral arrangements. However, certain control functions are still needed to ensure the arrangement is delivered as agreed and continues to meet the needs of the supplier. Imbalance and transaction costs cannot be avoided and will be included in the fee charged by the provider for the service.

Suppliers can also contract directly with generators, which can deliver significant contributions to the overall supply needs and provide access to additional revenue streams. Imbalance risks generally need to be managed by the supplier although these could be included in the third party service arrangement if that route is chosen.

Whichever route is chosen by the supplier to meet its electricity needs, appropriate systems and process need to be developed to ensure that volume and price risk are adequately managed, that regulatory requirements are fulfilled, and that all contracts with third parties are properly monitored.
