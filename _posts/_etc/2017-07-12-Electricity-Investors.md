title: "Investing in the Electricity Industry"
---
This post gives a broad brush account of the Electricity Market in Great Britain in the form of investor guidelines. It will be of interest to entreprenuers and investors who are looking to enter the market.

Modern economies rely on cheap, abundant energy. As well as driving factories, energy is necessary in offices, for transport and in the home. It is no surprise that nations wage war over energy security. Currently the energy industry is undergoing seismic changes. It has had to responds to the environmental considerations of air quality, water pollution and climate change, regulatory changes, demand fluctuations, price volatility, new competition, dwindling fossil fuel reserves and energy security concerns.

![World Energy Consumption][3]

The increase in energy consumption reflects the growing world population, growing economies and changes in lifestyle.

## UK Energy Consumption
Total energy consumption in the UK has fallen slightly since 1970 when it was 146 ktoe. More poignantly, the mix has changed significantly with industrial use declining and transport use increasing.

![UK Energy Consumption][4]

In the UK the majority of our "final consumption" of energy is oil & gas. Despite it's smaller share of final consumption, electricity is vitally important due to its utility in lighting and powering appliances (computers, fridges, washing machines). Electricity underpinned the 2nd industrial revolution and will play a key role in the 4th as it unfolds in the coming decades.

## Electricity Value Chain
![Energy Value Chain][7]

Using broad brush strokes, the electricity industry can be described as a simple value chain with 3 links - **generation**, **network** and **retail**.

A handful of important actors sit outside the main value chain. The Regulators and shared industry infrastructure are **"the bears"** who provide the systemic control that is necessary for a safety critical and economically vital public utility. **"The bulls"** are third parties such as traders, brokers and other intermediaries.

### Generation
Electricity is generated at industrial scale in a number of ways:

* Fossil fuels (mostly coal or gas)
* Nuclear fission
* Hydroelectric and wind power
* Solar PV

“Merchant generators" sell wholesale into unregulated markets. “Vertically integrated utilities” build and operate plants that sit alongside their businesses in other segments of the value chain.

### Network
Simplistically, this is the “poles and wires”.  This market segment is heavily regulated and comprises large natural monopolies. In the UK, National Grid and the DNOs dominate here. They do much more than meets the eye. In addition to the highly visible transformers, switch gear, poles and wires they operate complicated control mechanisms to ensure that power flows safely, economically, reliably and timely from where it is generated to where it is consumed.

### Retailers
In the UK consumers (including domestic, industrial and commercial) can freely choose their electricity supplier (aka retailer). Retailers buy power wholesale from generators and energy traders. which they then sell it to end users. Most retailers bundle electricity with gas. Some also include water, telecoms and financial services.

### Third Parties
Traders, brokers and others provide a number of commercial services which help improve the economic efficiency of electricity supply. This can range from energy futures and other derivatives to brokering small deals or providing price comparison services.

## Breakdown of an Energy Bill
![Break down of an Energy Bill][12]

An average UK household uses 3.1 MWh per annum. Household spending is around £1000 per annum on electricity and gas. There are 27 million electricity residential customers and 20 million gas, with around 1 million business customer accounts in addition.

## Wholesale Volatility
Demand for electricity fluctuates on a daily and seasonal basis. An unusually mild winter, for instance, can moderate consumption and squeeze revenues.

Wholesale electricity prices fluctuate with supply and demand. Electricity typically costs £30 to £40 per megawatt hour. But in certain conditions, it can temporarily go to £5,000 or £10,000 per megawatt hour.

![Multi-year wholesale fluctuation][13]

### Daily Demand Profiles
![Daily Profile in California][14]

The graph shows California's total electric load for a single day, the total load less solar and wind power (known as the duck curve) and solar power output. Data shown is for October 22, 2016, a day when the wind power output was low and steady throughout the day. Note duck curve's steep rise from 17:00 to 18:00 as the sun sets, requiring some 5 gigawatt of generating capacity to come on line within one hour.

### Negative Pricing
![Negative Wholesale Pricing][15]

In extreme circumstances, when the network is saturated by solar and wind, there can be negative prices for power. This is already a regular feature of many European electricity markets (e.g. Germany, Scandanavia and the Netherlands).  In May 2015, the intra-day market in GB saw negative pricing for the first time.

## The Challenges of Retailing Electricity
In simplistic terms, retailers procure electricity on the wholesale market and sell it on to households and/or businesses.

Retailers choose who they buy their electricity from in the competitive wholesale market, whilst customers are free to pick from scores of retail suppliers.

Furthermore to be a supplier, you need an electric supply licence from Ofgem which mandates compliance with industry codes, metering, prepayment, marketing etc. The electricity licence comprises 459 pages. The total page count in the associated codes (e.g. the Smart Energy Code) is much larger.

As well as complying with regulation, the general operations of a supplier include:

- Gaining customers
- Managing meter reading.
- Forecasting demand and sourcing the right amount of electricity.
- Billing customers
- Customer care

Typically a supplier orchestrates a network of agents and partners to execute specific parts of the retail business. Ultimately however, the regulatory buck stops with the supplier.

![Customer Centric Electricity Retail][18]

Information technology underpins this network and is a significant investment for retailers large and small. The main systems deal with billing, customer information, customer engagement and market messaging.

Retailers deploy electronic equipment at the point of use to help provide accurate consumption data and to execute *demand side management*. The most common approach is through smart meters and AMR. However, better results can be achieved if measurement and control is done against circuits or loads (e.g. heaters) instead of at a premise level.

## Analyst's Insights
The electricity industry is generally a good bet for investment. However, many large energy companies are starting to lose their classification as safe bets in the face of the demanding and fast changing market environment. In the past most utilities paid high dividends and carried low risk as the industry was non-cyclical and would be less impacted by economic downturns than the rest of the market.

![Porter's Five Forces][2]

### Threat of Substitutes
Electric power is a necessity and at a fundamental level it doesn't have a substitute. However, in recent years wind and solar PV have made a huge impact. Not only is this changing the shape of the electric grid, it is also viable for households and businesses to generate locally to reduce their net demand.

Despite the uptake of renewables, short-term demand for power is inelastic. This means that price increases does little to reduce consumption in the near term.

![EV's will push up demand for Electricity][6]

Through advances in electric vehicles and heating equipment, electricity's share of the final consumption is expected to soar. Battery and other storage technologies will improve the economics and utility of renewable generation.

NB transportation is already widely electrified. Network Rail is huge consumer of electricity in the UK. Per annum it spends £300 million on electricity with £250 million on rail traction alone.

### Threat of New Entrants
![UK Domestic Retailers][16]

Structural changes in the UK energy market have lead to a huge increase in entry opportunities, especially at the trading and retailing end of the market where upfront capital requirements are relatively modest.

Renewables have also significantly disrupted the development of new generation plants. However, the regulatory regime maintains natural monopolies for National Grid and the DNOs.

This new competition has impacted the generation and retail market share of the "big 6". In particular EOn and RWE nPower have lost a lot of ground in the retail market.

### Bargaining Power
The effect of increased numbers of traders, retailers and merchant generators means that electricity industry profits are being spread over more players. Nevertheless, the UK electricity market is still dominated by the Big 6, National Grid and the DNOs.

For consumers electricity can be treated as a commodity. Evidence suggests that lower and fixed prices are increasingly important for both domestic and business customers. In particular large commercial and industrial users have significant leverage through long-term purchasing agreements. Households are also increasing their buying clout through collective switching and price comparison services.

### Industry Rivalry
Rivalry in the electricity industry is fierce in generation, retail and with TPIs. Utilities must fight for market share in order to create the economies of scale needed to lower costs and remain competitive. Because nearly everybody already uses a utility, competitors are forced to rely mainly on lower prices and to capture market share. This tends to drive industry profitability down.

There is some competition around the network and the market control systems. However, these segments are not free markets as they comprise mostly of natural monopolies.

Corporate reputation and brand are key differentiators. The whole market category is under constant scrutiny by regulators, environmentalists, businesses and households. Ovo Energy regularly play this card through advertising and CEO interviews.

Some new entrants are trying to differentiate through bundling non-energy services. There are also indicators that offerings such as energy as a service are just around the corner. However, regulation and other market forces can dampen creativity and present huge challenges to innovators.

Despite their best efforts large incumbents are faced with the dilemma of protecting their current revenues or developing new business models to replace them. Whilst CEO of NRG, David Crane's ideas for transforming the incumbent utility were about as welcome as a fart in a space suit.

Whereas, Elon Musk of Tesla is lauded for repeated bold moves which are helping define the electric utility of the future.

## The Electricity Industry is Inside a Tornado of Change
The UK plays an important role within the global electricity industry. There are relatively free markets in retail and generation, London is a centre for new energy finance and start-ups, National Grid is a world leader in high voltage and there is a strong entrepreneurial spirit across the whole value chain.

Key areas of innovation to watch include:

- **Active grid**: Sensors, real time data transfer and artificial intelligence promise to drive up efficiency and remove bottle necks within the transmission and distribution grids
- **Distributed Generation**: We continue to see significant and sustained improvements in solar and wind. This spans technology, finance, build and operations.
- **Demand Side Management**: Smart control of loads will help reduce bills and ultimately lead to new value propositions like heating as a service.
- **Energy Storage**: Will transform the whole value chain from industrial scale schemes on the grid, down to behind the meter batteries in homes and businesses.
- **Electric Vehicles**: Electric cars, buses and trucks are possibly the most important innovation for improving air quality and reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
- **Community Energy**: New technology and changes in regulation mean that communities can take more control of the electricity. This includes a range of operating models including "Yield Co" (e.g. Bristol Energy Coop) and "micro grid" (e.g. Energy Local).

Despite there being an air of inevitability, the complexities involved in the above means that it is unclear who will be the winners and losers.

Amongst this uncertainty, it is blindly obvious that  electronics and software are the driving force as the electricity industry moves out of the carbon era.

In tandem to the change brought on by technologists and entrepreneurs, the UK government is placing several large bets.

In retail, the importance of the smart meter programme was reaffirmed in the Conservative Party Manifesto and there was a recent review through the Competitive Markets Authority. BEIS and Ofgem are committed to centralised registration, faster customer switching, tariff innovation and demand response schemes. There is the possibility of price caps on energy bills for consumers.

On the network Ofgem, BEIS and the industry are working on transforming DNOs into DSOs and defining the future role of the system operator.

Whilst in generation, the decision to approve Hinkley Point C underscored the impact government decision makers have in the industry.

## Conclusion
Investors have opportunities to seize and pitfalls to avoid in the electricity category.

Large transmission and distribution firms still look like the old fashioned monopolies. They are decoupled from market fluctuations and protected from new entrants. However, at best they offer only modest returns. This is a good market for risk-averse investors or as the meat and potatoes of a diversified portfolio.

In the UK, the large vertically integrated utilities ("the big 6") are a mixed bag. Their economies of scale are a boon but their lack of agility is a bane. Most are investing in diversification and keeping growth-hungry competitors at bay. Fortunes are likely to be cyclical, canny investors who can play with bulls and bears can earn good returns.

The wholesale trading market carries a lot of risk - both upside and downside. Investors should be aware that share prices can react almost instantaneously to prices swings in wholesale markets, changes in credit ratings and news headlines.

- **Price/Earnings** ratio remains the key yardstick for comparing large players in the electricity industry where dividend performance is still an important part of their business model.
- **Debt/Equity** is another vital sign. 50% is a decent mark for merchant generators, whereas vertically integrated generators can afford slightly higher debt/equity ratios.

Speculative investors in technology and innovation see the electricity industry as a place of lucrative opportunities. Elon Musk is the poster boy of innovation in the market. He is helping to set the tone but is also leaving plenty of room for many others.
