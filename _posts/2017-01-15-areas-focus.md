I enjoyed [Becoming the Best Version of You][1] from the Tim Ferris Show. It was a special episode comprising a live conversation with not one, not two, but three guests: Josh Waitzkin, Ramit Sethi, and Adam Robinson.

Pretending to be one of Tim's guests put a twist on my annual retrospective and planning. Here is at the imaginary Q&A I'd have with Tim to help kick off 2017. 

## Which thinkers influenced you the most in 2016?
Geoffrey Moore and David Allen.

Geoffrey Moore latest book Zone to Win is fascinating and one of my favourite reads in 2016. Moore is a "Serial Authorpreneur" whose books are my key source of inspiration and knowledge around marketing strategy for the digital world. Crossing the Chasm is a long standing business classic. It has sold more than one million copies by addressing the challenges faced by start-up companies. The 2014 edition third has dozens of recent examples of successes and failures.

David Allen is an author of several books about his time management method "Getting Things Done"(GTD). I've been been a keen practitioner for several years. The method is deep, philosophical, practical and flexible. It takes a few hours to learn but a lifetime of practice to master. 

## What did you learn last year that will be a key to success in 2017?
Geoffrey Moore's Zone to Win has underpinned a lot of my thinking in 2016. More importantly, having deployed the key ideas at Tilix and with several of my clients, I know Zone to Win can lead to good results.

In particular I have found the 2x2 matrix of the incubation, transformation, performance and productivity a good device for focussing teams on what is important and the tactics they should deploy.

I look forward to optimising my Zone to Win thinking and action in 2017. Most notably, this year Tilix's Part Time IT Director service will be transformed into a material source of revenue and profit. In Zone to Win terms means this means that  Tilix will scale up our innovation in packaging IT Director services so that it:

- Constitutes more than ten percent of revenues
- Is on a stable growth trajectory 
-  Offers better profit margins than other lines of business

This has already been signalled to all my key stakeholders and is now out there on the world wide web. This is mission-critical and people are watching!

## What decisions have you made for 2017 that you wish you had made earlier?
I am going to deliberately practice my soft skills.

It has always been clear throughout my career that soft skills are vitally important. I've learnt a great deal about the arts of communication, motivation etc through practising methods like PRINCE 2, TOGAF, Lean and Agile. However, these are highly technical and (I surmise) that these are hard skills because they can be examined and certified.

Late in 2016 I reached a higher level of consciousness regarding soft skills. To say that I have been heavily influenced by the MITx course "u.lab: Leading From the Emerging Future" is an understatement. I would have liked to have learned the wisdom of Otto Scharmer earlier.

I've worked hard for many years on improving communication, courtesy, flexibility etc. However, Otto Scharmer et al have helped me take this to a heightened level of energy and passion. 

I am now listening to the world with a far more open mind and open heart. In 2017 I will engage at micro, meso, macro and mundo levels with a sense of future possibility. I will act from the emerging whole of the inevitable transition of energy from dirty fossil fuels to clean, cheap and sustainable renewables.

## What advice will you act on in 2017 that you previously ignored?
Peter Drucker is the darling of management consultants and oft quoted in their slide decks. For quite some time I've liked the following: 

>Because its purpose is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two—and only these two—basic functions: marketing and innovation.

I haven't exactly ignored this advice but its fair to say that I have not fully embraced the marketing approach. So the following Drucker quote is on the money:  

>Despite the emphasis on marketing and the marketing approach, marketing is still rhetoric rather than reality in far too many businesses.

These two quotes sit side by side in "Management". In 2017 I hope that Tilix does marketing for real and does away with the rhetoric.

## What would you like to improve most in the new year?
Marketing! More specifically, as Drucker puts it, I would like Tilix to excel at creating customers and be more market-focused in our actions as well as in our conversations.

The aim is to know and understand our customer so well that Tilix services fits neatly with what the customer wants to buy and almost sell themselves.

## What changes to your routines will you make?
I have been a student of GTD for a few years now and work at continually improving my technique. One of the core mental models in GTD is [The 6 Horizons of Focus][2]:

1. __Runway:__ Tasks
2. __10,000 feet:__ Projects
3. __20,000 feet:__ Accountabilities
4. __30,000 feet:__ 6 month to 1 year desired outcomes
5. __40,000 feet:__ 3 to 5 year goals/objectives
6. __50,000 feet:__ Purpose of life

Levels 5 & 6 are topics that come easily in conversations with my friends and family in front of a roaring fire, whilst walking in the woods or down the pub. These things don't change often and when they do it is normally at a manageable pace.

Levels 1 & 2 also come quite naturally. Juggling tasks day to day and projects week to week is what I've been doing for a living for many years. I've got a box of tools, a library full of techniques and tons of experience to help me here. Additionally, the immediacy of deadlines and being kept in check by co-workers helps to keep me out of the rough.

In contrast, maintaining discipline around levels 3 and 4 is something I have had to work hard at. The basic questions are simple enough:

* What's your job?
* Where is your job going?

There a few factors that make it challenging for me to answer. First, I work at the cutting edge of technology and this can make it very difficult to pin down exactly what I do! Second, my chosen domain is the energy industry and it is currently going through seismic changes. Third, as my own boss I don't have the guiding hand of a line manager to help define my role or illuminate my career path.

## What will be your headline story for 2017?
In 2017 Tilix will finish shedding the skin of its formative years. What will emerge is a mature consultancy business with perspective, momentum and control around the following three horizons:

- **Horizon 1** generating today’s cash flow.
- **Horizon 2** pipelining deals that are expected to pay back significantly, but in 12-36 months time.
- **Horizon 3** future opportunities for 3-5 years away. These make claims against R&D budgets but do not affect the go-to-market operating plan.
