With the latest phenomena of EVs in the energy industry, we wanted to know more about what this will mean for the future of smart energy. Uniti, an up and coming electric vehicle platform based in the south of Sweden, have blown the industry away with their innovative design ideas for their first electric car, and what it could mean for the future of all urban cities. Two years later, and Uniti are now in the prototype phase of the car design, nearly ready for their electric autonomous vehicle to be manufactured and put out on the roads. 

This is a space to be watched, and to become even more excited about as a smarter future is fast approaching. Dr Neil Williams, the co-founder of Tilix, was so impressed by Uniti's ideology and scope to create the car that he invested early on in the company that describe their car as the best for the world. But what was it that sparked so much of an interest in this particular autonomous car design?

Firstly, they have thought of everything - from being more sustainable and more energy efficient, Uniti have managed to question every aspect of the typical car design and transform that into fitting the needs of every driver in the most energy efficient way possible. This scales from a different approach to production, using less energy to design the car and using different materials and processes, therefore lessening the waste and pollution caused by the production process, especially in comparison to standard car manufacturers.

This ranges all the way from the larger parts of the car's outer shell, to the small details of software development where the software has been designed with the driver in mind so that the software will "feel like an extension of yourself". Uniti have opted to switch materials such as iron to carbon fibre, a more mechanically advanced material that is lighter weight and therefore more energy efficient as well as high performance. An [EU whitepaper (2011)][1] discussing the the European transport area for the future stated that "the use of smaller, lighter and more specialised road passenger vehicles must be encouraged." Uniti have taken on board every aspect of information to make their EV as environmentally friendly as possible. The dry weight of Uniti will be 450kg, and will have significantly lower level of emissions of particulate matter, which is said to affect ["more people than any other pollutant"][2]. This supports CEO Lewis Horne's statement that Uniti will bring "clean electric mobility in cities" and help provide a cleaner future for urban areas.

Designing their EV to be entirely recyclable and also using bio composite based materials, they have thought ahead for not just the next generation to come, but even the next century. 
Uniti have described themselves as "an electric car company with big ambitions" and its not hard to see why - the entire car has been designed entirely from scratch, allowing them to 
create the car from an entirely new point of view, without having to take into consideration any [aspects of the other industry][3]. Talking to Verena Kitowski, HR at Uniti, we discussed how cars have been the same for decades, but phones have undergone a huge development and have moved on from what they used to be. So why can't cars? It makes sense. It's about being resourceful. That is really the future," she explains. "If you knew all the facts, you wouldn't want to drive a normal car anymore.

Making vehicles autonomous has proved to enhance the safety aspect of driving, as sensors surrounding the car will be able to detect movement from afar. Uniti have utilised IoT to 
also not only add to the simplicity of the car, but by studying usage patterns of drivers, they have been able to identify what the driver wants, and edit those interactions of drivers with 
technology to create a seamless and safer driving experience. For example, there are absolutely no buttons within the car, but the car features a highly efficient information management system using voice recognition and one touchpad. The entire windscreen will feature as a head-up display, enhancing the safety of the driver by having all the optics on the dashboard for navigation and overlay. Other physical aspects of the car include an entirely new concept for the interior design. According to Uniti's research statistics, the average number of people per car-ride is 1.2 passengers, so Uniti have decided to make the car a two-seater, with the driver in the front whilst the passenger sits behind in the back. 

Another extremely futuristic function of the car is the new steering concept, where two bars have been put in place of the standard steering wheel to create a smoother and easier, more natural style of driving. During the testing phase, they let all ages from infants to older citizens try out the steering system and sit in the interior of the car to discover which new concept was the most flawless and smooth running for the driver. Uniti believe that this steer-by-wire concept could "unlock a new era of intuitive driving" as well as create a more fun experience for the driver. However, standard steering will also be available for this who aren't yet comfortable with the idea of computer-assisted vehicle control.

So when can you purchase one of these EVs, and when will you get it delivered by? Well Uniti have in fact already began taking orders, and are expecting the first deliveries of the EP1 to be taking place mid 2019. Uniti have proved to the world that their "clean, sustainable electric automotive" could be a real changing point in the future of smart energy, and help to make our cities a cleaner, less polluted place. Michael, the chairman of Uniti, sums up the goal of Uniti in his statement, "We aim to be the world's most resource efficient vehicle company". Is it time to turn electric? We believe so.
